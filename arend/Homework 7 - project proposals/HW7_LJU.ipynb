    "I was thinking it would be an interesting and fun challenge to program the game of chess. It wouldn't be too hard I believe to program automatic moves for the computer and perhaps the player would have to use a move function each turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "For something more related to biology or evolution two other ideas I had was to make a program that navigates a maze or minimizes steps to a key spot. Or create a fitness landscape where the ideal genome changes every generation (in a predictable or unpredictable way) and use this to see how diversity of genotypes changes in response. I could compare this to how diversity of genotypes changes over generations in the way we programmed fitness landscapes in class 13 and 14. "
