    "Legumes have evolved a symbiotic relationship with a group of bacteria known collectively as rhizobia. The basis of this interaction is the exchange of resources. Legumes are unable to use diatomic nitrogen, the most readily available form of nitrogen, directly from the soil. To aquire nitrogen, these plants develop mutualistic interactions with rhizobia in which the rhizobia infect root systems of plants and form nodules where they fix diatomic nitrogen into a biologically useful form and the plants allocate phytosynthetically produced carbon to the bacterial partners. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, some rhizobial partners are inherently less benefical and fail to produce as much if any nitrogen as their mutualistic counterparts. In order to combat this, leguminous plants have developed a response theorized as \"sanctioning.\" This process somehow restricts the growth of the cheating organisms during early stages of the mutualism. However, the process driving this dynamic is not understood. Furthermore, it is not known why cheaters are still present in soil microbial populations when legumes are preferentially allocating resources to beneficial partners. \n",
    "\n",
    "I propose to model the interaction between these two partners to begin to understand if other potentially destabilizing effects must be in play that allow the cheaters to continue propoagating. Below, I will first model the interaction showing the theorized rate of fixing (beneficial), cheating (non-beneficial), and mixed (nodules containing both types of rhizobia) infection. The goals are as follows: \n",
    "1. To see if cheating populations will be driven out in models that allow the repopulation of cheaters through mixed nodules alone. \n",
    "2. Observe how the rate of mixed infections alters the dynamic observed in goal 1. \n",
    "3. Observe if variable sanctioning mechanisms could result in further sustaining the cheating populations. "
